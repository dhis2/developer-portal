We're excited to announce that the revamped [DHIS2 Developer Portal](/) is live! üéä  
The portal serves as a single hub for all developer-focused content, features several improvements on documentation, and offers a better user interface to the growing developer community.

<!--truncate-->

This is a work in progress but for now let's see what's new üëá

## Documentation

The docs page offers a well-organized documentation system. The sidebar is divided into different types of docs:

-   [**Quick Start**](/docs/): Learn how to connect to a DHIS2 local instance and create a new application
-   [**Tutorials**](/docs/): Learn the basics of DHIS2 app development and get familiar with the DHIS2 App Platform, as well as components and libraries
-   [**How-To-Guides**](/docs/guides): Get easy step-by-step guides to do something specific
-   [**Reference**](/docs/aditionalreferences): Get more more technical information like the DHIS2 Web API
-   [**Conceptual**](/docs/conceptual): Get higher-level explanations of DHIS2 concepts in general

The goal is to make it easier for developers to find information, regardless of the level of experience developing DHIS2 applications. Whether developers are learning, building, or trying to understand a specific topic, the new documentation system will help facilitate this process.

## Blog

This features the same [blog](/blog) content as before, which highlights announcements of new versions of different libraries, updates, and other communications like this one. The plan is to add a functionality to comment on our blogs.

## Events

The [Events](/events/webinars) page offers a sidebar that organizes events by type (e.g. Webinars, Developer Academy, and Annual Conference). This is in the works but the idea is to keep adding more information on past and upcoming events and to facilitate consulting and navigating these resources.

## Community

The [Community](/community) page is an important one as it provides links and resources to the DHIS2 Developer Community. 

## Contribution

Easier way to contribute to our docs pages. You'll find the _Edit this page_ link at the bottom of most pages and this will take you to the GitHub repo, where you can add your changes and help us improve our documentation. We encourage the developer community to please contribute to the documentation and to help us keep it as up-to-date as possible.

### What's next?

We'll continue to add more content and other capabilities like a search bar, blog commenting, and translation. Stay tuned!

Hopefully you will like the new website and if you have any feedback, or notice a broken link, please feel free to reach out to us! üôè
