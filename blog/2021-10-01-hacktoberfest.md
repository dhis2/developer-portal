Every year, DigitalOcean and other partners sponsor [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to encourage open-source contributions. Contributors who make 4 or more useful pull-requests will be eligible to receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt. We also encourage you to consider the environmentally-conscious option of planting trees instead ðŸŒ³ðŸŽ‰

If you contribute (by opening a pull request which gets approved) to any open-source DHIS2 repository during the month of October, your contribution will count towards the 4 pull-request minimum required to claim your reward. Get hacking!
