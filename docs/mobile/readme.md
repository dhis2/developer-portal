# Mobile Documentation

Welcome to the documentation section for Mobile development, where you'll find resources and guides for the available libraries. 

## Mobile UI

DHIS2 Mobile UI library is an open source design system based on [Compose multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/). 
This library simplifies the development process by allowing developers to write Compose UI code once and target both Android and desktop platforms with minimal changes.

## Android SDK

DHIS2 Android SDK is a library that abstracts the complexity of interacting with DHIS2 web api. It aims to be a starting point 
to build Android apps for DHIS2, covering some tasks that any Android app should implement, like metadata and data synchronization.
