Welcome to the references section of the developer portal, where you'll find reference material for many of the tools available for DHIS2 developers. For deep dives on any DHIS2 development topic, have a look at the [Guides & Tutorials](/docs) section.

## Getting Started

The References section is categorized based on the type of tooling you are looking for.

### Web Development

Most of the Web Development documentation can be found in [Guides & Tutorials](/docs). However, if you are looking for a the references you have arrived at the right location. Most notably all [Web UI Components](/docs/ui/webcomponents) are documented here. Links to API documentation can be found in the sidebar as well.

### CLI Tooling

The CLI Tooling section contains references for the [DHIS2 CLI](/docs/cli), which is a powerful tool for managing DHIS2 applications.

### Android Development
