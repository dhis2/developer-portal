title: How to spin up a DHIS2 local instance
---

This is a quick guide on how to easily create a DHIS2 instance on your local machine and setup the DHIS2 CLI.

Some of the benefits of using local instances are: (1) we can run multiple different DHIS2 versions at the same time and (2) testing is easier as the DHIS2 server runs locally and is not dependent on a network connection.

> These steps will help you quickly spin up a server and get you started with DHIS2 application development!

## 1. Installation

First, make sure to install the following ðŸ‘‡

-   Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
-   Install the DHIS2 [CLI](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/getting-started) globally:

```shell
yarn global add @dhis2/cli
```

Check the `d2` command-line tool with `d2 --help` for more information on available commands.

## 2. Run d2 cluster

The [d2 cluster](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/commands/d2-cluster) command will allow you to launch a new cluster and create a DHIS2 instance using Docker containers. From your terminal, run the following:

```shell
d2 cluster up <name>
```

Or spin up a new DHIS2 instance of a specific version seeded with data from the Sierra Leone [demo database](https://dhis2.org/demo).

```shell
d2 cluster up 2.35.0 --db-version 2.35 --seed
```

**Note:** Once the `up` command completes, the server might take up to a couple of minutes to start. You can then run `d2 cluster logs 2.35.0` and wait until you see the line `Server startup in xxx ms`.

> If you want to test against different DHIS2 and database versions or build your own custom DHIS2 Docker image, please refer to the [d2 cluster](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/commands/d2-cluster) docs.

### Check your new DHIS2 instance

After the above command has completed you can check your newly created cluster that's running locally at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). If DHIS2 is running, you should see the following page:

Login to your instance:

```
username: admin
password: district
```

### Destroy and cleanup commands

The `down` command followed by the name of the cluster shuts down all Docker processes connected to that cluster (it basically destroys a running container):

```shell
d2 cluster down 2.35.0
```

The command `down --clean` destroys that cluster _and also_ clears out all saved configuration, data volumes, and ephemeral containers:

```shell
d2 cluster down 2.35.0 --clean
```
