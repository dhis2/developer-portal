It's time to create a new Web app! Below we'll show you how to quickly bootstrap an app and how to connect it to a DHIS2 instance (check the previous section if you haven't yet installed yarn or the DHIS2 CLI which will provide the d2 command used below).

### Creating a new Web app

1. From the terminal, create a new DHIS2 app called "my-app"

```shell
d2 app scripts init my-app
```

2. Change directories to `./my-app` and start the app

```shell
cd my-app && yarn start
```

### Connecting your Web app to DHIS2

1. From the browser, navigate to your DHIS2 instance url (if you're running DHIS2 locally via container the address is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). You will see the following page:

2. Enter your DHIS2 server URL and the username and password of the default admin user (local DHIS2 instance assumed in the example below)

```
server: http://localhost:8080
username: admin
password: district
```
:::note
If you're running into some Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [(CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) policy issues when trying to connect to your application, please check the guide on [how to debug common development errors](../guides/debug-instance).

3. You will see the default admin user name and a welcome message

Congratulations! You are ready to start developing a DHIS2 app ðŸŽŠ
