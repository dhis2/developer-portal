The [DHIS2 Python Client](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-python-client) is a lightweight yet powerful library designed to connect DHIS2 with the wider data science ecosystem.

It was built to meet the needs of data practitioners, analysts, and program managers who rely on DHIS2 as a cornerstone of their information systems. While many climate, environmental, or socio-economic datasets may come from outside DHIS2, this client ensures that DHIS2 data can be easily accessed, integrated, and contributed back. Used alongside other [Climate Tools](https://climate-tools.dhis2.org/about/), it becomes part of a broader ecosystem that brings diverse data sources together for harmonization, orchestration, analysis, and ultimately decision-making.

The client makes it simple to pull data out of DHIS2 for analysis and push curated results back into DHIS2 for use in dashboards, decision-making, or further integration.

## Getting started

The library is packaged as part of the Climate Tools ecosystem but, if you want to use it outside this ecosystem, installation instructions and other details are available from the [DHIS2 Python Client GitHub repository](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-python-client). An example of using the client is documented in the [DHIS2 Climate Tools page](https://climate-tools.dhis2.org/org-units/download-web-api/).
