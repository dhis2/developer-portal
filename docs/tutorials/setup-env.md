This tutorial will help you set up your local development environment to build your first DHIS2 app using the [DHIS2 Application Platform](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/), which provides a full-featured DHIS2 app, with out-of-the-box tools and components ready to be customized for your use case.

In this section we will:

1. Install Node.js and Yarn
2. Install the [DHIS2 CLI](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/)
3. Initialize a new DHIS2 app

## 1. Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed before proceeding:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Make sure that you are running a compatible version of Node as using older versions may throw some errors during setup.

2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## 2. Install the DHIS2 CLI

We'll start by installing the [DHIS2 CLI](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/) (Command Line Interface) globally.

The `@dhis2/cli` package provides a set of tools that are useful when developing DHIS2 apps. It contains a number of modules that lets you quickly create and maintain DHIS2 applications. It also allows you to manage local DHIS2 instances by running simple commands.

To install `@dhis2/cli` globally run the following command using `yarn`:

```shell
yarn global add @dhis2/cli
```

Verify your installation and check all the commands that are available to you:

```shell
d2 --help
```

You‚Äôre now ready to start using `@dhis2/cli` commands to create a new app! ‚ú®

## 3. Initialize a new DHIS2 app

Now you are ready to use the `d2` CLI tool to create your first DHIS2 app.

The `d2` CLI provides a simple way of initializing a new app. We'll use the [d2-app-scripts init command](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/init) to do that.

From your terminal, navigate to the where you want to create your project and then run the following command:

```shell
d2 app scripts init <app-name>
# <app-name> must be replaced with your app name.
```

We can now navigate into the newly created folder and start your application locally:

```shell
cd <app-name>
yarn start
```

### Connecting your app to a DHIS2 instance

After running `yarn start` a web-browser window should have popped up greeting you with a login dialog at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Enter your own development instance of DHIS2 as the server URL and the username and password of the default admin user (as shown in the example below):

```
server: http://localhost:8080
username: admin
password: district
```

> If you want to learn how to spin up a local DHIS2 instance using Docker and the `d2 cluster` command of the [DHIS2 CLI](https://cli.dhis2.nu/#/commands/d2-cluster) please follow [this guide](/docs/guides/spin-up-local-instance).

You will then see your newly initialized application greeting screen like this one üëá

**Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing a DHIS2 application!** üëèüèΩ
