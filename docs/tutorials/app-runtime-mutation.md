title: Data Mutation
---

This tutorial is a continuation of the [DHIS2 application runtime](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/getting-started) tutorial on [Data Query](/docs/tutorials/app-runtime-query).

In this section we will:

1. Get started with data mutations
2. Learn how to define these mutations
3. Mutate data using the `useDataMutation` hook

### 1. Getting started

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the `@dhis2/app-runtime` dependency installed in your project:

```shell
yarn add @dhis2/app-runtime
```

### What are data mutations?

Data queries are for reading information and **data mutations** are for writing or changing that information.

With the DHIS2 app runtime, we have 3 different types of mutation which translate directly to REST API requests:

| Mutation Type | REST requests |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Create        | POST          |
| Update        | PUT           |
| Delete        | DELETE        |

## 2. Define data mutations

In this example, we will continue building on the application from the [previous tutorial](/docs/tutorials/app-runtime-query) and **create a new program** by clicking a button.

To start, let's create a separate file for our `src/NewProgram.js` component which we will import in the `src/App.js`.

Next, let's define a simple create mutation üëá

### Create mutation

As with the data query definition from the previous tutorial, the create mutation below is also an object that specifies the resource `programs` from the DHIS2 Web API as well as the following required properties:

-   The property `type` as `create` (since we're creating a new program in this example)
-   The `data` property which is required in type `create`

:::note
The property names of **`data`** must correspond to the property names in the DHIS2 API.
:::

```jsx title="src/NewProgram.js"
// ...

const myMutation = {
    resource: 'programs',
    type: 'create',
    data: {
        name: 'A new Program',
        shortName: 'A new Program',
        programType: 'WITH_REGISTRATION',
    },
}
// ...
```

## 3. Mutating data

We have already declared our data mutation above so now we're ready to use it!

Let's start by importing the [`useDataMutation` hook](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/useDataMutation) from the `@dhis2/app-runtime`

### Import `useDataMutation`

```jsx title="src/NewProgram.js"
import { useDataMutation } from '@dhis2/app-runtime'
// ...
```

### Use the `useDataMutation` hook

Next, let's define our React functional component `NewProgram` which will use the `useDataMutation` hook.

Check the highlighted code below and notice a few things:

1. We get the `mutate` function in the array that's returned by the `useDataMutation` hook. We can call this function to execute the mutation:
    - So we then pass the `myMutation` object to the `useDataMutation` hook
2. We have created an `onClick` [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) that will be passed to the `Button` component. Here, the `mutate()` function is called as well as `refetch()`

    - **Note**: The `refetch` function comes from the parent component `src/App.js` and the `useDataQuery` hook (see next section below) which can be called to refetch data and has the behaviour of updating the information after the first load has completed. In this case, after a new program has been created.

```jsx {15-19} title="src/NewProgram.js"
import { useDataMutation } from '@dhis2/app-runtime'
import { Button } from '@dhis2/ui'

const myMutation = {
    resource: 'programs',
    type: 'create',
    data: {
        name: 'A new Program',
        shortName: 'A new Program',
        programType: 'WITH_REGISTRATION',
    },
}

export const NewProgram = ({ refetch }) => {
    const [mutate, { loading }] = useDataMutation(myMutation)

    const onClick = async () => {
        await mutate()
        refetch()
    }
    return (
        <Button primary small disabled={loading} onClick={onClick}>
            + New
        </Button>
    )
}
```

### Use the `NewProgram` component

We can now import the `src/NewProgram.js` component in `src/MyApp.js`.

The highlighted code inside the `MyApp` functional component shows the `refetch` function mentioned above which is passed as props to its child component `NewProgram`:

```jsx {3,16,24} title="src/App.js"
import React from 'react'
import { useDataQuery } from '@dhis2/app-runtime'
import { NewProgram } from './NewProgram'

const myQuery = {
    results: {
        resource: 'programs',
        params: {
            pageSize: 5,
            fields: ['id', 'displayName'],
        },
    },
}

const MyApp = () => {
    const { loading, error, data, refetch } = useDataQuery(myQuery)

    if (error) {
        return <span>ERROR: {error.message}</span>
    }
    if (loading) {
        return <span>Loading...</span>
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Programs</h1>
            <NewProgram refetch={refetch} />
            <ul>
                {data.results.programs.map((prog) => (
                    <li key={prog.id}>{prog.displayName}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    )
}
export default MyApp
```

### Check your browser

When you click the button **`+ New`** a new program will be added to the list üëè

### _Optional:_ Delete a program

<details>

<summary>See belowüëá</summary>
&nbsp;
<p>If you want to delete a program, you can create the following component:</p>

```jsx title="src/DeleteProgram.js"
import { useDataMutation } from '@dhis2/app-runtime'
import { Button } from '@dhis2/ui'

const deleteMutation = {
    resource: 'programs',
    type: 'delete',
    id: ({ id }) => id,
}

export const DeleteProgram = ({ id, refetch }) => {
    const [mutate, { loading }] = useDataMutation(deleteMutation)

    const onClick = () => {
        mutate({ id }).then(refetch)
    }

    return (
        <>
            <Button small destructive disabled={loading} onClick={onClick}>
                Delete
            </Button>
        </>
    )
}
```

Then add it to your application:

```jsx {2,9} title="src/App.js"
// ...
import { DeleteProgram } from './DeleteProgram'

// ...
;<ul>
    {data.results.programs.map((prog) => (
        <li key={prog.id}>
            {prog.displayName}
            <DeleteProgram id={prog.id} refetch={refetch}>
                Delete
            </DeleteProgram>
        </li>
    ))}
</ul>
// ...
```
