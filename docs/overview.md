## Getting started

If you haven't set up your development environment yet, you can follow the [Initial Setup](/docs/quickstart) guide. This will explain how to install the necessary tools and set up your environment to get started with development and spin up a new server.

### Web Development

If you're looking to develop DHIS2 web applications, you can use the [Quickstart Web](/docs/quickstart/quickstart-web) guide to get started. This guide will help you set up your development environment and create a new DHIS2 web application.

Once that is done, you might want to check out the following sections: 

- [Application Platform](/docs/app-platform/getting-started)
