## Where To Get Help

If you need help with your DHIS2 Web and Android app, you can join the following communities to get support:

### Community of Practice

Read through the [Support - Assistance technique](https://community.dhis2.org/c/support/8) category or the [Development - Développement](https://community.dhis2.org/c/development/10) category and ask your own questions.

### Slack Workspace for DHIS2 Developers
