Did you know that the DHIS2 Developer Community hosts monthly meetups? ðŸ¤©

### What are these meetups?

A series of online and informal meetings with the DHIS2 Developer Community. These meetups are a great way for developers working on DHIS2-related projects to connect, ask questions and stay updated.

Topics range from meet and greet to technical web development discussions. These are some of topics covered so far in past meetings:

-   DHIS2 UI library and Design System
-   What makes a good generic DHIS2 application?
-   How to use the DataStore?
-   DHIS2 application testing with Cypress
-   Meet and Greet, general Q&A

Keep an eye on the CoP [announcement](https://community.dhis2.org/c/announcements/22) category for our next live community event or join the **DHIS2 Developer Community Slack Workspace** to know more.

Looking forward to seeing you there! ðŸŽŠ
