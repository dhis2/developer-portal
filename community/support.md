## DHIS2 Developer Community 

DHIS2 has a large community of developers around the world using DHIS2 tools and libraries. 

If you need help with your DHIS2 Web and Android applications, you can join the following communities to get support:  

### Community of Practice 

Many members of the community use the [Community of Practice](https://community.dhis2.org/) to ask questions. Read through the [Support - Assistance technique](https://community.dhis2.org/c/support/8) category or the [Development - Développement](https://community.dhis2.org/c/development/10) category and ask your own questions. 

### Slack Workspace for DHIS2 Developers
