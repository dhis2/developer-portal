## DHIS2 Developer Community

DHIS2 has a large community of developers around the world using DHIS2 tools and libraries.

If you need help with your DHIS2 Web and Android applications, you can join the following communities to get support:

### Community of Practice (CoP)

Many members of the community use the [Community of Practice](https://community.dhis2.org/) (CoP) to ask questions. Read through the [Support - Assistance technique](https://community.dhis2.org/c/support/8) category or the [Development - DÃ©veloppement](https://community.dhis2.org/c/development/10) category and ask your own questions.

### Slack Workspace for DHIS2 Developers

We have created the DHIS2 Developers Slack Workspace to have a place to interact, ask questions and to share developer-focused information and events.

Please share your interest in joining the [Slack Worskpace](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuPQsMfEcLkCTiR87RhCG8v4eZZTf4CNPCFuAtRndEI211xA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by filling out this google form and we will make sure you invite you as soon as possible!
